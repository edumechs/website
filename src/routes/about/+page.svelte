			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>
				In classrooms and workshops, we&apos;d often show educators the learning kits we were using
				to teach mechatronics. Almost every time, the response followed a familiar pattern: strong
				interest, followed by hesitation once the cost came up.
			</p>
			<p>
				It became clear that while the value of hands-on technical education was obvious, the price
				of existing equipment made it out of reach for most classrooms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our mission is to empower educators and students with a learning platform designed to offer
				the same core experiences in automation, electronics, and control systems, but at a price
				point that makes sense for real educators and real schools.

				<h2>
					Young people are increasingly<br /><span class="highlight-it"

				<p>
					Even as the need for technically skilled workers is rising across Canada, many young
					people overlook these careers simply because they haven&apos;t had the chance to
					experience what working with automation, electronics, or machinery actually feels like.
				</p>
				<p>
					As older workers retire and technology transforms the trades, the gap between opportunity
					and awareness is only getting wider.

					<p>
						Many students never consider a career in skilled trades or technical fields, not because

						Research shows that early exposure to hands-on learning dramatically increases the
						likelihood that students will see themselves in these roles.

			<h2>Our Commitment to Educators</h2>
			<p>
				We built EDU MECHS to remove the barriers that keep students from experiencing technical
				education firsthand. We're not just building learning kitsâ€”we're building access,
				confidence, and curiosity. Every part of EDU MECHS is designed to support educators and
				spark lasting engagement in technical careers.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe students learn best when they can see how things work, touch the components, and
				connect learning to the real world. That's why everything we create is hands-on,
				classroom-ready, and built to grow with your teaching.
