				to teach mechatronics. Almost every time, the response followed a familiar pattern: strong
				interest, followed by hesitation once the cost came up.</p> <p class="svelte-6dg18r">It became clear that while the value of hands-on technical education was obvious, the price
				of existing equipment made it out of reach for most classrooms.</p> <p class="svelte-6dg18r">Our mission is to empower educators and students with a learning platform designed to offer
				the same core experiences in automation, electronics, and control systems, but at a price
				point that makes sense for real educators and real schools.</p></div></section> <section class="values svelte-6dg18r"><div class="content-container fadeinz svelte-6dg18r"><h2 class="svelte-6dg18r">Our Values</h2> <div class="table svelte-6dg18r"><div class="value-container svelte-6dg18r"><div class="left-two svelte-6dg18r"><span class="number svelte-6dg18r">01</span> <span class="value svelte-6dg18r">Hands-on Learning</span></div> <p class="description svelte-6dg18r">We believe students learn best by doing.

					people overlook these careers simply because they haven&apos;t had the chance to
					experience what working with automation, electronics, or machinery actually feels like.</p> <p>As older workers retire and technology transforms the trades, the gap between opportunity
					and awareness is only getting wider.</p> <div class="stats-row fadeinz svelte-6dg18r"><div class="stat svelte-6dg18r"><span class="stat-percent highlight svelte-6dg18r">16<span class="perc svelte-6dg18r">%</span></span> <p class="stat-text svelte-6dg18r">Only 16% of young people consider skilled trades as a career.

						they aren&apos;t interested, but because they&apos;ve never had the chance to try.
						Research shows that early exposure to hands-on learning dramatically increases the
						likelihood that students will see themselves in these roles.</p> <p>Without opportunities to build, test, and explore, entire career paths stay hidden.</p></div></div> <div class="icon-reading svelte-6dg18r"><div class="reading retire fadeinz svelte-6dg18r"><h2 class="svelte-6dg18r"><span class="highlight-it">700 000+</span> skilled trades workers expected to <span class="highlight-it">retire by 2028</span></h2> <p>Canada is facing a massive wave of retirements in skilled trades.
