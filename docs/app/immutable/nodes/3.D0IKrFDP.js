				to teach mechatronics. Almost every time, the response followed a familiar pattern: strong
				interest, followed by hesitation once the cost came up.</p> <p class="svelte-m8732m">It became clear that while the value of hands-on technical education was obvious, the price
				of existing equipment made it out of reach for most classrooms.</p> <p class="svelte-m8732m">Our mission is to empower educators and students with a learning platform designed to offer
				the same core experiences in automation, electronics, and control systems, but at a price
				point that makes sense for real educators and real schools.</p></div></section> <section class="values svelte-m8732m"><div class="content-container fadeinz svelte-m8732m"><h2 class="svelte-m8732m">Our Values</h2> <div class="table svelte-m8732m"><div class="value-container svelte-m8732m"><div class="left-two svelte-m8732m"><span class="number svelte-m8732m">01</span> <span class="value svelte-m8732m">Hands-on Learning</span></div> <p class="description svelte-m8732m">We believe students learn best by doing.

					people overlook these careers simply because they haven&apos;t had the chance to
					experience what working with automation, electronics, or machinery actually feels like.</p> <p>As older workers retire and technology transforms the trades, the gap between opportunity
					and awareness is only getting wider.</p> <div class="stats-row fadeinz svelte-m8732m"><div class="stat svelte-m8732m"><span class="stat-percent highlight svelte-m8732m">16<span class="perc svelte-m8732m">%</span></span> <p class="stat-text svelte-m8732m">Only 16% of young people consider skilled trades as a career.
